## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60), tidy=TRUE) 
```

```{r package, message=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(openxlsx)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(forecast)  
library(Kendall)
library(tseries)
library(outliers)
library(tidyverse)
library(smooth)
library(zoo)
library(kableExtra)
```

Importing Data
```{r}
#importing data
load <- read_excel("/home/guest/ForecastingCompetition/data/raw/load.xlsx")

#Creating a data frame with daily observations
load <- load %>% 
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(daily_avg = mean(c_across(h1:h24), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(load, aes(x=date,y=daily_avg)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("Average Daily Load")

summary(load$daily_avg)

```

Converting into time series
```{r}
load_daily <- msts(load$daily_avg, 
                           seasonal.periods =c(7,365.25),
                           start=c(2005,01,01))
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
